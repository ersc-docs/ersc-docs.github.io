<summary>For the Leda final fight</summary>

> <b><u> You need to be at least 2 players in the session to complete it. </u></b>
> <b><u> Only the person that interact with the sign will see the enemies. </u></b><br /> 
>  
> 1. Have the host interact with the sign.  
> 2. Kill the hostile NPCs.  
> 3. Have Wanderers use the Finger Severer when host enters the loadingscreen after the fight: ![image](https://github.com/ersc-docs/ersc-docs.github.io/assets/174225858/303b3ff6-c435-48c4-ba12-52d299d898c0)  
> 4. Have Wanderers rejoin the session.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>Infinite loading screen</summary>

> This could have multiple causes, but most likely you're stuck at an invalid location.  
> For example, DLC region without owning the correct DLC.
>   
> [The Grand Archives Cheat Table](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Elden-Ring-CT-TGA/) has a script to get out of the loading screen.  
> You can find it at `Scripts -> Seamless Co-op -> Loading screen stuck fix` in the cheat table.
