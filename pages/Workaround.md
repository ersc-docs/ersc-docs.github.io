<details markdown="block">
<summary> Workaround for Milicent's and DLC Needle Knight Leda's invasion signs.  </summary>

> <b><u>Make backups of your save files before attempting</u></b>
>
><b><u>DO AT YOUR OWN RISK</u></b>
>
><b><u>NOTE:</u></b> You can <a id="raw-url" href="https://github.com/ersc-docs/ersc-docs.github.io/tree/main/assets/txt/steam_appid.txt">click here to take you to the steam_appid.txt download.</a>.
> Then put the `steam_appid.txt` file into your game folder and launch the game from `eldenring.exe` to start vanilla in offline mode. 
>
>
>1. go to appdata > roaming > elden ring
>2. There will be 2 sets of files in these folders, one set named .co2 and one .sl2 (co2 is seamless coop and sl2 is vanilla)
>3. Cut, not copy, the vanilla .sl2 files somewhere else, like a documents folder
>4. Rename the .co2 files to .sl2, this will convert them into vanilla characters
>5. <b><u>Launch the vanilla game in offline mode (read NOTE above)</u></b>, and complete the battle.
>6. Once the battle is over, close the game, change the converted file type back into .co2, and put the vanilla saves back in
>7. Continue seamless coop normally
>
>
> <b>NOTE:</b> For Needle Knight Leda, you could alternatively use the [Debug Tool](https://github.com/Nordgaren/Elden-Ring-Debug-Tool/releases/latest/) or [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php) + the [TGA table](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Elden-Ring-CT-TGA/releases/latest/) and warp yourself to `Divine Gate Front Staircase`.
>
> <b>NOTE 2:</b> For Milicent you could use the [Debug Tool](https://github.com/Nordgaren/Elden-Ring-Debug-Tool/releases/latest/) or [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php) + the [TGA table](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Elden-Ring-CT-TGA/releases/latest/) to give yourself the items you are missing out on.

> But as always when doing things like this. Make a backup before hand.

<summary> Workaround Sellen's Assisting sign.  </summary>

> Temporary warkaround provided by NeoDim + friends. Done as a party of 3
>
> <b>Make a manual backup before attempting since it involved alt+F4ing out.</b>
>
>
> 1. Assisting Sellen after killing Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, with these steps:
> 2. Use the gold summon sign with a full party of 3 players. You should see a Site of Grace and won't be able to fight after joining Sellen.
> 3. Use Mimic Tear Ashes to kill Witch-Hunter Jerren. Sellen must survive.
> 4. Everyone, except the host, disconnects using the Finger Severer.
> 5. The host quits using ALT+F4.
> 6. Upon loading back, you should still be a gold summon, but Sellen will be standing in the center of the room. You should be able to walk out of the arena now.
> 7. Fast travel back to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library Site of Grace. Now you won't be a gold summon and can talk to her.
>
> <b>NOTE 2:</b> You could alternatively use the [Debug Tool](https://github.com/Nordgaren/Elden-Ring-Debug-Tool/releases/latest/) or [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php) + the [TGA table](https://github.com/The-Grand-Archives/Elden-Ring-CT-TGA/releases/latest/) to give yourself the items you are missing out on.
